    """ Principal Hilbert Curve. \n
    
    Vectorized implementation of the principal Hilbert curve by J. Skilling.
    
    Reference:
    J. Skilling, "Programming the Hilbert curve". AIP Conf. Proc., 2004, 707, 
    381-387.
    
    Algorithm:
    A single global Gray code is being applied to the np-bit binary rep. of the 
    Hilbert distance/index H. This overtransforms the distance H and the excess 
    work is undone by a single traverse through the np-bit Gray code rep. of H.
    
    Args:
        n: dimensionality of the curve (int).
        p: number of bits in each dimension (int).
    
    Returns:
        Two-dimensional numpy array. Entry (i,j) contains the the i'th component
        of the coordinate to the j'th point along the principal Hilbert curve.

        for m in range(n):
            # if bit q of of coordinate m is OFF
            mask = H[m] & q == 0
            # then exchange low bits of coordinate n and m:
